# logiccino
# logic gates project using the app Blynk
- As of now it has 5 gates:
    *and, or, not, nand, nor 
- Virtual pins on the app's widgets:
    
    input A = vpin 1

    input B = vpin 2

    gate menu = vpin 3

    3x3 table = vpin 4

    terminal for parsing = vpin 5

    output = vpin 6

# terminal will take a conditional statement in form of string 
# and parse it into truth tables

    eg. ("not ( p and not q )") 

    app displays the corresponding truth table
